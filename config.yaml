# Minecraft RL Bot Configuration
# ===============================
# This file contains all hyperparameters and settings for training.
# Edit these values to tune the training process.

# Training Parameters
# -------------------
num_episodes: 10000           # Total episodes to train
max_steps_per_episode: 10000  # Maximum steps per episode
batch_size: 64                # Number of steps per optimization batch
gamma: 0.99                   # Discount factor for returns
gae_lambda: 0.95              # Lambda for Generalized Advantage Estimation
learning_rate: 0.0003         # Optimizer learning rate (Adam)
value_loss_coef: 0.5          # Weight for value loss
entropy_coef: 0.01            # Weight for entropy bonus (encourages exploration)
max_grad_norm: 0.5            # Maximum gradient norm for clipping

# Logging and Checkpointing
# -------------------------
log_interval: 10              # Episodes between logging
save_interval: 100            # Episodes between checkpoints
eval_interval: 50             # Episodes between evaluation runs

# Paths
# -----
checkpoint_dir: checkpoints   # Directory for saving checkpoints

# Features
# --------
use_curriculum: true          # Whether to use curriculum learning
continuous_actions: false     # Use continuous (true) or discrete (false) actions

# Random Seed
# -----------
seed: 42                      # Random seed for reproducibility

# Model Architecture (Advanced)
# -----------------------------
# These are advanced settings - modify with caution
# block_channels: 32          # Channels in block encoder output
# hidden_dim: 128             # Hidden layer dimension
# obs_size: 21                # Observation region size (21x21x21)

# Exploration
# -----------
# epsilon_start: 1.0          # Initial exploration rate
# epsilon_end: 0.01           # Final exploration rate
# epsilon_decay: 0.995        # Decay rate per episode

# Curriculum Stages (in order of progression)
# -------------------------------------------
# 1. BASIC_SURVIVAL - Learn to survive, move around safely
# 2. RESOURCE_GATHERING - Mine blocks, collect items
# 3. TOOL_CRAFTING - Craft tools, use crafting systems
# 4. NETHER_ACCESS - Build and enter Nether portal
# 5. BLAZE_HUNTING - Find fortress, kill Blazes
# 6. ENDER_PEARL_HUNT - Collect Ender Pearls
# 7. END_PREPARATION - Craft Eyes, find stronghold
# 8. DRAGON_FIGHT - Enter End, defeat dragon
# 9. FULL_GAME - Complete speedrun

# Reward Shaping
# --------------
# Positive rewards:
# - Mining valuable items (coal, iron, diamond)
# - Crafting tools and items
# - Surviving days
# - Entering Nether/End
# - Defeating Ender Dragon
#
# Negative rewards:
# - Taking damage (fall, mobs, lava)
#
# Note: Only damage causes negative rewards to avoid
# discouraging exploration.

# Low-Resource Hardware Tips
# --------------------------
# If running on limited hardware:
# - Set batch_size to 32 or lower
# - Reduce max_steps_per_episode to 5000
# - Increase log_interval to reduce I/O
# - Set continuous_actions: false for discrete (faster)
